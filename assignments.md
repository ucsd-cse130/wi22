## Late Policy 

You have a total of *five late days* that you can use throughout the quarter,
but no more than *four late days* per assignment.
    
- A late day means anything between 1 second and 23
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline    
- If you submit past the late day limit, you get 0 points for that assignment
- There is no penalty for submitting late but within the limit

## Sample Exam Questions

Note: 2018 exams are the most representative. Older exams use OCaml instead of Haskell.
Check out these [lecture notes](https://ucsd-cse130.github.io/web/lectures/02-haskell.html)
for a comparison between the two languages.
