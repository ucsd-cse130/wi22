### Homework Assignments (45%)

There will be *six* programming assignments, assigned every one or two weeks.
Instructions on turning them in will be posted with each assignment.

**Partners**

- You can work on the assignment *either alone or in groups of two*.
- *Every student* has to turn in their solution, even if their solution is identical to their partner's.

### Midterm (25%)

Will be held in class on **Thursday February 10**.

The format will be announced before the midterm.

### Final (30%)
  
Will be held on **Tuesday March 15**.

The format will be announced before the final.
  
Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will be calculated as 
`midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`. This means that you get a second 
chance if you donâ€™t do well on the midterm but you **must turn in both the midterm and the final**.
### Discussions (+5%)

Extra credit for top-20 best participants in Piazza discussions,
determined by the instruction team.
